# AdventureTime

The **goal** for making this app was to become familiar with iOS app development in general, Swift, Xcode and APIs.

- App is made for **iOS** and written in **Swift 5** with **Xcode**. 
- Displays flights to everywhere from location inputted by user on the inputted date. Results are sorted in ascending order with respect to price
- Retrieves data by utilizing the **Skyscanner API** on RapidAPI.
- Follows **MVVM** pattern

| Opening App | Make Multiple Searches | Alerts for Wrong Inputs |
| :---:         |     :---:      |          :---: |

### Plans for future iterations:

- Make image displayed behind flights related to the City destination
- Make flights clickable to display additional data
- Allow user to book a flight (either directly or via link to third-party)
